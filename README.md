# Subscription renewal tool

This plugin was built as a proof-of-concept to assist a non-profit which has a large number of manual renewals. Many members will pay for the annual subscription via bank transfer and checque, and this tool helps identify the renewal in question, allowing an admin to search quickly for the subscription by email address.

Then without opening the subscription they are able to execute a renewal, resetting the next payment date as preferred.
